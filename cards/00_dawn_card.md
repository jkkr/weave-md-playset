00 DAWN CARD
---
This paragaph is a description of the overall tone of the card, and what it means to you as the writer. Weave uses this paragraph to give to both the players during character creation and the storyteller during episode creation.


BACKSTORIES
---
## Explaining Backstories
This is a description paragraph of what would appear when you scan a card. A card has 3 backstories. The "double hashtag" symbol at the beginning of a new line is a reserved symbol for the titles of qualities inside of a playset. The text that follows is the actual title itself. In this case, the title of this quality would be "Explaining Backstories"

Text can be added in with underscores at the beginning and end of the final paragraph to indicate that it will only be shown to the storyteller. See the example below:

_This paragraph starts and ends with an underscore. This indicates that this text can only be viewed by the storyteller and not by any player_

## Applying Tags to a Backstory
Tags are an easy way to apply context to any quality. They are used by the storyteller and other qualities to identify certain effects or circumstances that would arise. They single words indicated in a list as shown below.

_please note that the following text here is still considered the last paragraph of the quality, and should be placed BEFORE the tag list_

- SINGLE
- WORDS
- ONLY

## Attended school of double wand spell-fighting
You went to a very prestigous school of double wand spell-fighting. It's like spell-fighting with a regular wand, except you have TWO wands. Someone should write a book about this, and they did. That's why you went to school about it.

_The education they received while useful was only partially correct. The instructor was poorly educated in it and only used the word prestigous in the brochure to get rich families to sign up_

- MAGICAL
- EDUCATED
- SPELL-FIGHTER


TALENTS
---
## Example talent
Talents are skills that a character has that could help aid them in their quest. They are different from backstories in that they have are usually used in a specific circumstance or set of circumstances. There are 4 talents for every card.

## Example talent (continued)
While Weave does allow for flexible rules, be careful not to add too many game mechanics to talents unless it is necessary for the feel and flavor of the talent involved.

## Example talent (continued)
Just like any quality, talents can have storyteller text and tags.

_While not common in talents storyteller text could still be useful. Maybe this talent comes at a cost the player may not be immediately aware of, or may require certain items to use_

- EXAMPLE
- CONTINUATION
- TAG
- LIST

## Rockclimbing
You are really darn good at rock climbing, or any climbing really. I mean after you scaled that big cliff, you got pretty good at climbing or scaling a lot of things. Within reason of course.

_If they try to climb something unreasonable, feel free to say no. Consider adding an additional die only if they use items that are appropriate for rock climbing._

- OUTDOORS
- ADVENTUROUS
- PHYSICAL


FLAWS
---
## Example Flaw
Flaws are semi-generalized or specialized qualities of a character that a storyteller uses to either remove a die for a specific challenge in a given circumstance or for an enticement. There are 4 flaws for each card.

## Example Flaw (continued)
Try to make flaws that can be interchangeable between characters. For instance if you have another card that says "has three arms" in one card, a flaw that is titled "only one arm" in another card might create an issue if the player choose both.

## Example Flaw (continued)
Flaws follow the rules of qualities and although rare, flaws can use storyteller text and tags if necessary.

## Scared of Heights
You are unusually scared of heights. Maybe it was that one time you went rockclimbing, but you can't seem to shake the fear of falling if you look down from a large height.


SIGNATURE MOVE
---
## Example Signature Move
Signature moves are usually used only once in an episode, and thus have game mechanics that are pretty powerful. Examples of powerful game mechanics could be receiving two extra dice, ignoring strikes, re-rolling strikes, re-rolling all dice, assisting all players with an extra die, etc. These can also include flavor to the story that can still affect the outcome. Bruce Banner turning into the incredible hulk would be a good example, as the size of the character would grow, which might affect certain situations in gameplay. There is only one signature move per card.


ITEMS
---
## Example Item
![Example Item Image](images/logo.png)
Items are useful in a story to characters, but don't always mean that they gain an extra die in a challenge. They also may be used to also make an action possible, which in turn may require a challenge. There are 2 items in every card.


## Battery-powered Flashlight
![Example Item Image](images/logo.png)
Your favorite flashlight for delving into caves, and certainly the brightest one on the market. Hopefully the batteries are still fresh...

_After three uses of the flashlight or after continuous use, consider having the batteries run out_

- BRIGHT
- SMALL
- ELECTRICAL


NPCS
---
## Example NPC
![Example NPC Image](images/logo.png)
NPC stands for non-player character, and are used by the storyteller as someone who may travel with the players or assist them briefly in the story. There are 2 NPCs in every card.

## Old Man Gygax
![Example NPC Image](images/logo.png)
A older man with a white beard and stocky build. He seems like the type who can ramble and describe things or events at great length, and always has books with him whereever he goes

_Gygax will be more open to talk to players that have a *MAGICAL* tag associated with them. All others may have to perform a Brooks Challenge to keep him on topic_


ENEMIES
---
## Example Enemy
![Example Enemy Image](images/logo.png)
Enemies are great ways to keep players on course or challenge them during lulls in the story. They reserve the right to have non-player actions in an encounter. There are 2 enemies in a card, and typically involve one enemy being singular and the other enemy being plural in numbers.

## Swarm of Huge Moths
![Example Enemy Image](images/logo.png)
These moths are huge. Like really huge, and their razor sharp wings could perform can cut deep against any that get in their way

_Moths are more likely to be attracted to any player that have a *BRIGHT* tag associated with them._


PLOT TWISTS
---
## Blinded by the Light
A bright light blinds all who fail a challenge card pulled by the storyteller after plaing this card.  If players pass the challenge they can see just fine after the sudden flash.

## Disoriented and Lost
A magical trap was placed somewhere where your players are, and when it went off the players were disoriented by it's affects, and find themselves in another location. This may be a good time to play a location card to find out where they went, unless there is already a place in mind.


LOCATIONS
---
## A sunny open field
![Example Location Image](images/logo.png)
The players are in a open field.  The sky clear of clouds, a soft gentle breeze brings the scents of flowers to the players' noses.

## Royal Mansion
![Example Location Image](images/logo.png)
Were they summoned here or is this one of the players' homes?  Nether the less it is a rather large house equiped with the right amount of staff to keep the place looking spotless.

_The players will be greeted by either a staff member or the owner of this fine house._


THEME
---
## Light of a new era
Adventures from around the world are gathering in groups taking on dungeons, quests, and danger alike.  Some of which contains magic, strange items, and of course glory.  The players are faced with a many options of what they want and how to obtain it.  It'll be a team effort to make sure they live to see the next light of day.
